# FootballTournament
Simple Football Tournament Calendar creator

# Description
This is just a simple Uni project, language is currently in Italian Only, if someone is interested I'll translate it.
Basically it takes a text file with team names and ability level, creates a calendar with 1st round and 2nd round and plays the matches with a really simple random logic.
Since it's just a proof-of-concept it's not so complicated and detailed, could be really improved, expecially the algorythm that created the matches calendar (will take some time if you try to compute with 400 teams ;) ).
